#Shanwan gamepad script for linux

I have found only bits of code on the internet.
First thing of interest is that on windows, the computer sends back an instruction to power on the controller, while on linux it does not happen.
Also I have found that this script works best with xboxdrv, so make sure you have that installed, and uninstall XPAD.

This script was used as inspiration
https://gist.github.com/dnmodder/de2df973323b7c6acf45f40dc66e8db3

Usage:
sudo python fixcontroller.py

This script should take care of anything related to the gamepad.
Just run it and leave it in the background.
Terminate it when you've finished playing.

Enjoy!
